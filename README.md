# Hangman

(A new Flutter project)

## Getting Started

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game.

The game starts with filling out a series of question marks (?) that represent each letter in the word. 

Guess letters that might be in the word. 

Each time a correct letter is guessed, it is added to the corresponding question mark (?) , and the player gets another turn to guess a new letter.

However, if the player guesses incorrectly, a part of the hangman (typically a stick figure) is drawn, and the player loses a turn.

The game continues until either the word is correctly guessed, or the entire hangman is drawn. 

If the word is guessed before the hangman is completed, the player(s) win. 

If the hangman is completed before the word is guessed, the player(s) lose.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
